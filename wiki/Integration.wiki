#summary A small manual for Eclipse integration

= Installation =

Developed and tested under Eclipse 3.3.1.1.
Requires JDT, EMF 2.2.3 and Java 5 or higher.

Download three `*`.jar files from [http://code.google.com/p/java2ecore/downloads/list downloads page]:
 * org.abreslav.java2ecore.jar
 * org.abreslav.java2ecore.transformation.jar
 * org.abreslav.java2ecore.transformation.ui.jar

Copy them to Eclipse plugins directory.

Restart Eclipse with {{{-clear}}} command-line parameter.

= How does !Java2Ecore integrate with Eclipse =

It just uses standard Java editor for entering text. 

In addition it defines a project builder and a nature. 

To start using Java2Ecore on some files in your project you have to perform the following steps:
 * Your project must be a Java project (either plug-in project or not)

 * Go to project properties Java Build Path page
  * Select Libraries tab
  * Click Add External JARs...
  * Select org.abreslav.java2ecore.jar from Eclipse plug-ins directory
  * Click OK
 * You will use some special annotations and classes from this JAR (see [Syntax] section)

 * Right-click your project and choose "Toggle Java2Ecore nature"
  * This will enable Java2Ecore builder on your project

 * Create new Source folder and name it {{{ecores}}} - this name is mandatory
  * It would have been much better if we would use some property page but for now you have to hard-code some name

 * Now for all the `*`.java files placed under {{{ecores}}} source folder our builder will work and produce models

 * Models are put to {{{<project>/models}}} folder (it's hard-coded too :( )
 * File names are {{{<package_name>.ecore}}}
