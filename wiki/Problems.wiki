#summary A list of problems, unsupported things and not implemented features

*See also*
 * Our [http://code.google.com/p/java2ecore/issues/list bug-tracker]

= Not yet implemented =
 * Ecore annotations
 * Nested packages
 * Import of existing Ecore models (Ecore itself, for example)
 * Ecore2Java transformations

= Problems and known issues =
 * Fields in generic classes represented by interfaces (see [Syntax] section)
{{{
@Class interface A<T> {
class _{
    T field; // an error here: type parameter T is not visible from static inner class
}
}
}}} 
  * Workaround (ugly, but working):
{{{
@Class interface A<T> {
class _<T> { // Define the same type parameters as enclosing type does
    T field; 
}
}
}}}
 * No opportunity to place two models (`*`.java files) containing classes with same names in the same package (two Java classes with same names cannot appear in one package)
  * _Solution_ (not implemented): allow to declare model types inside package type


= Unsupported things =
 * Generic exceptions are not supported in Java, so !Java2Ecore does not support them
