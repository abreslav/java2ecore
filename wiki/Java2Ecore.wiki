= What is Java2ECore? =

Java2Ecore is a translator from a subset of Java language to [http://www.eclipse.org/emf EMF ECore]. 
Tha main idea is that you can simply define some classes in Java and they will be transformed to an ECore model.


= Advantages =

  * *Eclipse Java editor* is used for entering your code, this gives you all of it's features: type checking, code completion, outline an so on
  * *Full support for generics* - actually at first this was the main goal. All the generic-related things supported both in Java and EMF anre supported by Java2Ecore.
  * *Clear syntax* - most constructs are expressed in very natural manner. But, unfortunately, there are some exceptions.

= Disadvantages =

  * Java2Ecore uses *JDT DOM* and thus can hardly work out of Eclipse
  * Some ECore notions cannot be expressed in Java
  * Some syntax is ugly
